# Azure Certifications and Exams

Last month, I passed two Azure exams and earned the Azure Data Engineer Certification.

I take data engineer certificate as an example, to explain how to prepare and what the Azure certification exams look like.

## Overview

Microsoft has made big changes to its Azure certifications at Ignite conference 2018. The new certifications are role-based, more practical and have a narrower focus for each certification.

Currently, there are 9 role based azure certifications. To earn each certification, it is required to clear one or two certification exams. I list the current certifications and also the required exams in the following:

- Associate
  - Data Engineer (DP-200, DP-201)
  - Data Scientist (DP-100)
  - Administrator (AZ-104)
  - Security Engineer (AZ-500)
  - Database Administrator (DP-300)
  - AI Engineer (AI-100)
  - Developer (AZ-204)
- Expert
  - Solution Architect (AZ-303, AZ-304)
  - DevOps Engineer (AZ-400)

## Which certification is right for me?

Should you go with AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud? Whether you are looking to move into a high paying cloud career or just looking to declare your existing cloud skills, Azure certifications are a great choice. Besides all the benefits that will bring to your career, all the Azure certs can be obtained remotely, which is awesome when working from home to fight against COVID-19.

Once you decided which cloud provider path is right for you, your next step is to figure out which certification path is right for you. From my experience, since Microsoft's Azure certifications are role-based, it is better to select  the job title and also go through the skills measured for each certification.
