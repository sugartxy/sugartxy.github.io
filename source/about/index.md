My name is **Xinye Tang**. I am a ***Machine Learning Engineer*** and mainly focused on *Anomaly detection*, *Machine Learning* and *Big data*. Currently, I am the service owner of *Azure Key Vault ATP*  (Advanced Threat Protection). 

This is my personal blob,  and I am writing down my thoughts all around *Microsoft Azure*, *Databricks*, *Spark*, and other fun technologies.
